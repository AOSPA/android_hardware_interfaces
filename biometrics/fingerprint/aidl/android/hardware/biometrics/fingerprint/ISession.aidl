     * allow for keys to be invalidated when the user adds a new enrollment
     * after the key was created:
     * KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment and
     * KeyProtection.Builder.setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment.
     *
     * In addition, upon successful fingerprint authentication, the signed HAT
     * that is returned to the framework via ISessionCallback#onAuthenticated
     * must contain this identifier in the authenticatorId field.
     *
     * Returns an entropy-encoded random identifier associated with the current
     * set of enrollments via ISessionCallback#onAuthenticatorIdRetrieved. The
     * authenticatorId
     *   1) MUST change whenever a new fingerprint is enrolled
     *   2) MUST return 0 if no fingerprints are enrolled
     *   3) MUST not change if a fingerprint is deleted.

     * The following only applies to sensors that are configured as

     *
     * When invoked by the framework, the HAL implementation must perform the
     * following sequence of events:
     *   1) Verify the authenticity and integrity of the provided HAT
     *   2) Update the authenticatorId with a new entropy-encoded random number
     *   3) Persist the new authenticatorId to non-ephemeral storage
     *   4) Notify the framework that the above is completed, via
     *      ISessionCallback#onAuthenticatorInvalidated
     *
     * A practical use case of invalidation would be when the user adds a new
     * enrollment to a sensor managed by a different HAL instance. The
     * public android.security.keystore APIs bind keys to "all biometrics"
     * rather than "fingerprint-only" or "face-only" (see #getAuthenticatorId
     * for more details). As such, the framework would coordinate invalidation
     * across multiple biometric HALs as necessary.
