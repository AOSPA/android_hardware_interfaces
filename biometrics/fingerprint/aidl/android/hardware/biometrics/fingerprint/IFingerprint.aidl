     * Creates a session which can then be used by the framework to perform operations such as
     * enroll, authenticate, etc for the given sensorId and userId.
     *
     * A physical sensor identified by sensorId typically supports only a single in-flight session
     * at a time. As such, if a session is currently in a state other than SessionState::IDLING, the
     * HAL MUST finish or cancel the current operation and return to SessionState::IDLING before the
     * new session is created. For example:
     *   1) If a session for sensorId=0, userId=0 is currently in a cancellable state (see
     *      ICancellationSignal) such as SessionState::AUTHENTICATING and the framework requests a
     *      new session for sensorId=0, userId=10, the HAL must end the current session with
     *      Error::CANCELED, invoke ISessionCallback#onStateChanged with SessionState::IDLING, and
     *      then return a new session for sensorId=0, userId=10.
     *   2) If a session for sensorId=0, userId=0 is currently in a non-cancellable state such as
     *      SessionState::REMOVING_ENROLLMENTS, and the framework requests a new session for
     *      sensorId=0, userId=10, the HAL must finish the current operation before invoking
     *      ISessionCallback#onStateChanged with SessionState::IDLING, and return a new session for
     *      sensorId=0, userId=10.
     *
     * Implementations must store user-specific state or metadata in /data/vendor_de/<user>/fpdata
     * as specified by the SeLinux policy. This directory is created/removed by vold (see
     * vold_prepare_subdirs.cpp). Implementations may store additional user-specific data, such as
     * embeddings or templates in StrongBox.
     *
     * @param sensorId The sensor with which this session is being created.
     * @param userId The userId with which this session is being created.
     * @param cb Used to notify the framework.
     * @return A new session

    /**
     * generateChallenge:
     *
     * Begins a secure transaction request. Note that the challenge by itself is not useful. It only
     * becomes useful when wrapped in a verifiable message such as a HardwareAuthToken.
     *
     * Canonical example:
     *   1) User requests an operation, such as fingerprint enrollment.
     *   2) Fingerprint enrollment cannot happen until the user confirms their lockscreen credential
     *      (PIN/Pattern/Password).
     *   3) However, the biometric subsystem does not want just "any" proof of credential
     *      confirmation. It needs proof that the user explicitly authenticated credential in order
     *      to allow addition of biometric enrollments.
     * To secure this path, the following path is taken:
     *   1) Upon user requesting fingerprint enroll, the framework requests
     *      IFingerprint#generateChallenge
     *   2) Framework sends the challenge to the credential subsystem, and upon credential
     *      confirmation, a HAT is created, containing the challenge in the "challenge" field.
     *   3) Framework sends the HAT to the HAL, e.g. ISession#enroll.
     *   4) Implementation verifies the authenticity and integrity of the HAT.
     *   5) Implementation now has confidence that the user entered their credential to allow
     *      biometric enrollment.
     *
     * Note that the interface allows multiple in-flight challenges. For example, invoking
     * generateChallenge(0, 0, timeoutSec, cb) twice does not invalidate the first challenge. The
     * challenge is invalidated only when:
     *   1) The provided timeout expires, or
     *   2) IFingerprint#revokeChallenge is invoked
     *
     * For example, the following is a possible table of valid challenges:
     * ----------------------------------------------
     * | SensorId | UserId | ValidUntil | Challenge |
     * |----------|--------|------------|-----------|
     * | 0        | 0      | <Time1>    | <Random1> |
     * | 0        | 0      | <Time2>    | <Random2> |
     * | 1        | 0      | <Time3>    | <Random3> |
     * | 0        | 10     | <Time4>    | <Random4> |
     * ----------------------------------------------
     *
     * @param sensorId Sensor to associate the challenge with
     * @param userId User to associate the challenge with
     * @param timeoutSec Duration for which the challenge is valid for
     * @param cb Callback to notify the framework
